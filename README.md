# Customer_churn_Analysis
In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of customer churn using Power BI, aimed at identifying key factors contributing to customer attrition. Leveraging a dataset that included customer demographics, transaction history, and service usage patterns, I developed a robust dashboard to visualize and interpret the data effectively.
Key Features:
Data Preparation: Cleaned and transformed raw data to create a structured dataset suitable for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA to uncover trends, patterns, and correlations influencing customer churn.
Visualization: Created interactive visualizations to highlight churn rates, customer segments at risk, and the impact of various factors on retention.
Recommendations: Delivered strategic recommendations to enhance customer retention efforts, based on data-driven findings.

Tools:
Microsoft Power BI
